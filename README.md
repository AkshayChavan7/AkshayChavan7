### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am software developer and a technology enthusiast currently working as a full-stack developer at FinIQ Consulting India. I've 1+ years of experience in professional software development which includes Angular web development, Android and Python development. I love what I do and enjoy my work to the fullest. For me, coding for a problem statement is like solving puzzles which I never get bored of :)

I believe in creating a quality environment for me and the people around me, as this leads our mind to work efficiently and find solutions to our issues. I believe in quality rather than quantity because sometimes your circle decreases in size but increases in value. I am always open for freelancing and would love to collaborate with development communities.

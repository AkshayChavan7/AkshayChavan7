    ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
    I'm a software developer and a technology enthusiast currently working as a full-stack developer at FinIQ Consulting
    India. I've 1+ years of experience in professional software
    development which includes Angular web development, Android and
    Python development. I love what I do and enjoy my work to the
    fullest. For me, coding for a problem statement is like solving
    puzzles which I never get bored of :)
    
    I believe in creating a quality environment for me and the people
    around me, as this leads our mind to work efficiently and find
    solutions to our issues. I believe in quality rather than quantity
    because sometimes your circle decreases in size but increases in
    value. 
    
    I am always open for freelancing and would love to collaborate with
    development communities.
